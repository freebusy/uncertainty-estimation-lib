<br>

## Information

This repository is designed to uncertainty estimation (UE) in Natural language processing (NLP) problems. Using this library, you can get a quantitative estimate of uncertainty using the classical approach of entropy, maximum logits, maximum probability, or using the Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) method of averaged entropy, bald score, variation ratio, probability variation, softmax ratio, logits ratio.

## Documentation 

Documentation for this library can be found in [(DOCUMENTATION.md)](DOCUMENTATION.md#-uncertainty-estimation-documentation)

More information on each method can be found [here](DOCUMENTATION.md#more-details)

## Launch examples

For ease of use and to speed up the process of mastering the functionality of the library, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the startup examples that are in the file [LAUNCH_EXAMPLES.md](LAUNCH_EXAMPLES.md#-launch-examples-). 

To use the library functionality, you need to configure the config. A sample configuration of the config is presented in [configs/README.md](configs/README.md#recommendations-for-config).
